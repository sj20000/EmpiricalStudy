Causal Integration in Graph Neural Networks Toward Enhanced Classification: Benchmarking and Advancements for Robust Performance

This repository presents a benchmark study comparing standard and causal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a focus on graph classification tasks. 
The study explores the integration of causality into GNN models and evaluates its impact on performance, generalizability, and predictive accuracy across multiple datasets and domains.

Key Findings
- Causality-enhanced GNNs consistently outperform traditional GNN models in graph classification tasks.
- GNNs with causal features show improved generalizability across diverse datasets.
- The inclusion of causal elements significantly enhances the predictive accuracy of GNNs.

 Models & Datasets
We evaluate nine GNN models, including both traditional and causal-enhanced versions, across seven publicly available datasets spanning three distinct domains.
